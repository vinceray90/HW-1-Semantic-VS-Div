# HW-1-Semantic-VS-Div

This webpage was taken from the utsa-san-fsf-01-u-c repository on GitLab and was further refined by myself. The webpage itself was not altered in any way and the purpose of this submission is to display my capability to refine and condense the html and css code provided.  

A brief overview of the changes made are as follows:  
- Removed all *div* elements and replaced them with semantic tags such as *header, nav, figure, section, article, aside, footer.
- Added id *search-engine-optimization* to the corresponding element in the *content* section in order to link it correctly and function properly when using the nav bar.
- Created additional classes in the articles such as *section-articles, section-articles-img, section-articles-header* in order to consolidate the css code applied into one command without altering the look of the webpage. 
- notated all changes to the html and css in the order at which they were changed above the corresponding code.
- proof read work regularly.
